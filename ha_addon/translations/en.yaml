  power_input_alias:
    name: Power Input Alias
    description: "The alias of the sensor(s) that provide the current power input. For multi-phase setups, enter multiple sensors separated by commas (e.g., 'sensor.phase1_in,sensor.phase2_in,sensor.phase3_in')."
  power_output_alias:
    name: Power Output Alias
    description: "The alias of the sensor(s) that provide the current power output. For multi-phase setups, enter multiple sensors separated by commas (e.g., 'sensor.phase1_out,sensor.phase2_out,sensor.phase3_out'). If you only have one sensor for both input and output, leave this empty."
  poll_interval:
    name: Poll Interval
    description: "The interval in seconds at which the ct001 should poll the power input and output sensors. Usually you should leave this at 1 second. Ignore this if you are emulating a different device."
  disable_absolute_values:
    name: Allow Negative Values
    description: "If enabled, the ct001 emulator will allow negative values. This is only compatible with newer versions of the B2500 firmware. Ignore this if you are emulating a different device."
  device_types:
    name: Emulated Devices
    description: "Comma-separated list of devices to emulate (ct001, shellypro3em, shellyemg3, shellyproem50, shellypro3em_old, shellypro3em_new). The device type shellypro3em_old uses port 1010 (used up until B2500 firmware version 224). The device type shellypro3em_new uses the new port 2220 (used for B2500 firmare >=226). If you use shellypro3em, it will use shellypro3em_old and shellypro3em_new simultaneously for backwards compatibility. If possible, always prefer a Shelly device type over ct001."
  throttle_interval:
    name: Throttling Interval
    description: "Minimum time interval (in seconds) between power meter readings. When set to 0, throttling is disabled for maximum performance. For slower data sources or to prevent control instability, set to 1-3 seconds. Supports decimal values (e.g., 1.5 for 1.5 seconds). Increase this value if you're seeing oscillations or instability with slow data sources."
  log_level:
    name: Log Level
    description: "Controls the verbosity of log messages. Select 'critical' for only critical errors, 'error' for error messages and above, 'warning' for warnings and above, 'info' for informational messages and above (recommended), or 'debug' for detailed debugging information. Use 'debug' for troubleshooting connection or configuration issues."
  custom_config:
    name: Custom Config
    description: "Optional. Name of a custom config.ini file to use instead of the UI configuration. The file must be placed in the add-on's configuration directory."
