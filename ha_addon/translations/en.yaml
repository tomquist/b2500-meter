  power_input_alias:
    name: Power Input Alias
    description: "The alias of the sensor(s) that provide the current power input. For multi-phase setups, enter multiple sensors separated by commas (e.g., 'sensor.phase1_in,sensor.phase2_in,sensor.phase3_in')."
  power_output_alias:
    name: Power Output Alias
    description: "The alias of the sensor(s) that provide the current power output. For multi-phase setups, enter multiple sensors separated by commas (e.g., 'sensor.phase1_out,sensor.phase2_out,sensor.phase3_out'). If you only have one sensor for both input and output, leave this empty."
  poll_interval:
    name: Poll Interval
    description: "The interval in seconds at which the ct001 should poll the power input and output sensors. Usually you should leave this at 1 second. Ignore this if you are emulating a different device."
  disable_absolute_values:
    name: Allow Negative Values
    description: "If enabled, the ct001 emulator will allow negative values. This is only compatible with newer versions of the B2500 firmware. Ignore this if you are emulating a different device."
  device_types:
    name: Emulated Devices
    description: "Comma-separated list of devices to emulate (ct001, shellypro3em, shellyemg3, shellyproem50, shellypro3em_old, shellypro3em_new). The device type shellypro3em_old uses port 1010 (used up until B2500 firmware version 224). The device type shellypro3em_new uses the new port 2220 (used for B2500 firmare >=226). If you use shellypro3em, it will use shellypro3em_old and shellypro3em_new simultaneously for backwards compatibility. If possible, always prefer a Shelly device type over ct001."
  custom_config:
    name: Custom Config
    description: "Optional. Name of a custom config.ini file to use instead of the UI configuration. The file must be placed in the add-on's configuration directory."
