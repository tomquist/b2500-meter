"""Shared cross-backend e2e plumbing for the CT002 closed-loop sim tests.

Importable from the e2e suites in ``tests/`` (it isn't collected by pytest —
the filename doesn't match ``test_*``). Each suite defines its own tiny
autouse ``params=["python", "esphome"]`` fixture that sets
``ACTIVE_BACKEND`` here, and its harness reads it to pick the emulator:

  * ``python``  — in-process ``CT002`` over a real UDP socket, grid fed via
    the ``before_send`` hook, time from a controllable clock.
  * ``esphome`` — the compiled test-hooks host binary, driven over UDP with
    grid / clock / dedupe / balancer-config via the control channel.

See ``esphome/components/ct002/test_hooks.cpp`` for the control protocol.

    ``step()`` advances simulated time by the *slowest* battery's poll
    interval and delivers every poll that falls due inside that window, in
    time order -- so a battery polling three times as fast sends three
    requests per step, as it would on a real network.

    Polling every battery exactly once per step and then advancing the clock
    by the slowest interval, which is what the harnesses did before, gets two
    things wrong whenever the intervals differ: the fast battery is silently
    throttled to the slow one's rate, and it is stepped with its own (small)
    ``poll_interval`` as the physics ``dt`` while the clock moves by the large
    one, so its ramp and SoC integrate several times too slowly. With every
    battery on the same interval the two are identical -- one poll each, then
    one advance -- which is why this went unnoticed.

    ``_to_next`` holds each battery's time *remaining* until its next poll,
    never an absolute timestamp. Two things follow. Accumulation error stays at
    the float epsilon of the intervals rather than of a ~1.7e9 wall-clock value.
    And a test that jumps the clock by hand (``h.clock.advance(8)``, to reach a
    rotation deadline without polling through it) cannot desynchronise the
    schedule: the skipped polls are skipped, which is the point of such a jump,
    and each battery keeps its place in its own cycle across it. See
