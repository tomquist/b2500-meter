"""Regression: efficiency slot count must not thrash on meter noise.

Reported in issue #469: with three batteries and ``MIN_EFFICIENT_POWER=150``,
a ~300 W base load sits exactly at the 2-slot boundary
(``int(abs_target / min_efficient_power)`` flips between 1 and 2), and the
slot count had no hysteresis of its own — ``EFFICIENCY_HYSTERESIS_FACTOR``
only guarded the enter/exit-limiting boolean.  Every ±10 W meter-noise tick
toggled a battery between active and deprioritized, keeping the fade EMA
permanently mid-transition and the whole pool hunting (the
``mixed_venus_b2500/eff`` evaluation scenario never settled).

The fix gates slot-count *growth* behind the same 20% margin as exiting
limiting entirely: demand must reach ``k * min_efficient_power * 1.2`` to
activate a k-th unit, while shrinking stays immediate (mirroring how entering
limiting is immediate).

This drives :class:`LoadBalancer.compute_target` directly with a scripted
demand (same style as ``tests/test_balancer_empty_battery_lockup.py``) and
asserts the deprioritized set holds still under boundary noise but still
grows/shrinks on real demand changes.
