"""End-to-end regression: probe handoff under the log2 topology.

Covers two scenarios:

1. *Happy path* — probe handoff between two consumers with a
   live meter.  The grid must return to the deadband after the
   handoff.

2. *Stale-meter lockup* — what actually happened in the user's log:
   the push-based powermeter (HomeWizard) stops delivering new
   measurements part-way through the probe window, the
   ``before_send`` callback keeps serving the last-known values,
   and the balancer is forced to drive the rotation blind.  This
   is the reproduction of the 1.5-hour uncompensated-grid bug.

        This is the same scenario that used to lock up: the harness's in-test
        ``before_send`` does NOT implement staleness detection — when
        ``frozen_grid`` is set it silently returns the cached values — so the
        emulator has no way to know the meter has gone quiet and must drive the
        rotation blind.  Previously the balancer computed ``target ≈ 0`` from
        the pinned reading and the real grid drifted to the full magnitude of
        the load (what the user observed for ~1.5 h until manual restart).

        The adaptive grid-state predictor now keeps the *total* commanded output
        continuous through the handoff: it credits each battery's reported
        output change, so winding one unit down and another up nets to zero and
        the real grid stays near balance even though the meter is frozen.  The
        old assertion (``grid drifts > 40 W``) is therefore inverted here — the
        docstring of the previous version anticipated exactly this once the
        balancer could recover without help from the powermeter layer.

        This does NOT make the powermeter-layer staleness detection redundant:
        the predictor only suppresses *handoff-induced* drift, not a genuine
        load change that occurs while the meter is frozen (it has no meter
        signal to catch that).  The real fix for a sustained outage still lives
        one layer up — ``HomeWizardPowermeter`` / ``HomeAssistant`` raise
        ``ValueError`` on a too-old cache — and is exercised by
        :meth:`test_powermeter_stale_error_is_handled_gracefully`.

        Python-only: the frozen-meter trigger is injected through the
        in-process ``before_send`` hook, which has no ESPHome analog (the
        binary reads grid power from injected sensor values, not a
