"""Regression: balancer gets stuck at target=0 after probe handoff.

Originally reported against logs
``34dea19a_b2500_meter_2026-04-10T04-50-21.881Z.log``: a two-battery
system where both consumers self-report on phase ``B``, the balancer
kicks off an efficiency-rotation probe at 05:28:00, the probe completes
successfully at 05:28:15, and then the newly-active battery's target
snaps from 95 W → 0 W one tick later and is pinned at 0 W indefinitely
(visible in the log for ~1.5 hours until manual restart).  The grid
drifts ~97 W uncompensated for the entire window.

The root cause is exercised here via a *unit-level* repro that drives
:class:`LoadBalancer.compute_target` with the exact report sequence from
the log (two phase-B consumers, scripted power outputs and meter
readings) and asserts the active battery receives a reasonable target
after the handoff.
