"""The add-on's options must keep meaning what they meant in the add-on 2.x.

The fixture was produced by running the add-on's original ``run.sh`` (the
bashio script that rendered a ``config.ini``) over an options set that touches
every add-on option, and reading the settings back out of the file it wrote.
The add-on backend now derives the same settings from the same options without
that detour, and this pins them: a mapping that quietly changes what an option
does — a renamed key, a wrong unit, an option wired to the wrong field —
changes these values and fails here.

Regenerating the fixture is only correct when an option is *meant* to change
meaning, and that is a user-visible change.

Options newer than the add-on 2.x — the ``dashboard_*`` ones — have no run.sh
behaviour to record. They are carried here anyway, each set to something other
than its default, so the same assertion still fails if one stops reaching its
field. ``GeneralSettings.dashboard`` is pinned too even though no option feeds
it: in the add-on the dashboard is always on, and that is the assertion.
``web_config_enabled`` is pinned as unset for the same kind of reason —
``run.sh`` never wrote that key either, and the config editor here is the
dashboard's Configuration tab rather than something the options switch on.
