"""Regression: ramp pacing must not blind saturation detection (issue #522).

A full/empty battery cannot follow its command, so ramp pacing never grows its
per-poll cap and pins the reading it is sent at ``pace_base_step``.  Saturation
used to be scored from that *paced* reading (``last_target``), so whenever
``pace_base_step < min_target_for_saturation`` the detector saw an
"idle" command every poll, decayed the score, and never recognised the battery
as saturated — leaving it a fair share of a surplus it could not absorb (the
reporter's Venus E3 full on the PV-export phase, ~700 W exported instead of
charged into the healthy Venus A).

The fix scores saturation from the *unpaced* command intent
(``last_intent_reading``), so detection is independent of the pacing throttle.

This drives :class:`LoadBalancer.compute_target` directly (fake clock) with the
reporter's cross-phase layout and tuning: the full battery sits on the phase
carrying the PV surplus, so it is continuously commanded to charge while
reporting 0 W.
