"""Per-battery efficiency-window weight in the LoadBalancer.

The efficiency rotation deprioritizes some batteries at low demand (so the
active ones stay above ``min_efficient_power``) and rotates which one is active
for fair wear. ``efficiency_window_weight`` (a report-dict field, ``[0, 1]``,
neutral ``1.0``) biases that rotation: ``0.0`` parks a battery while limiting,
``1.0`` is full participation, and the active head holds its slot for
``efficiency_rotation_interval`` scaled by its weight.

These poke the balancer internals (``_priority`` / ``_deprioritized`` /
``_last_rotation``) directly, matching the existing balancer unit tests. The
C++ mirror is covered by the differential parity suite.
