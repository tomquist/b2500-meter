"""End-to-end tests for the ESPHome dashboard's document and write path.

Run against the **compiled host binary**, over the test-control channel, so
these cover the real code an ESP32 runs: the status document built from live
consumer/balancer state, and the control writes that come back the other way.

What they cannot cover is the HTTP layer around it. ESPHome has no web server
for the ``host`` platform — ``web_server`` is declared ESP32/ESP8266/BK72XX/
LN882X/RP2040/RTL87XX only, and ``web_server_base.h`` falls back to
``<ESPAsyncWebServer.h>`` off-ESP — so ``dashboard.cpp`` cannot be built here at
all. It is covered by the ESP32 compile matrix; everything behind it is covered
here, and the wire format itself by ``host_status_json_test.cpp``.
