"""Tier D end-to-end test: drives the AstraMeter BatterySimulator against the
ESPHome host-platform binary.

This is the canonical-client validation that the plan calls out as Tier D —
real UDP wire bytes from the same code real users run against their B2500s,
flowing through the real ct002 host binary (sensor cache → filter pipeline →
balancer → response builder → wire). Any drift between Python's BatterySimulator
expectations and the C++ port's response is caught here in a single integration
test.

Skipped when the ESPHome toolchain is not installed locally. Runs in CI
via the dedicated ``ct002-host-e2e`` job (.github/workflows/ci.yml), which
installs esphome, builds the host binary, and runs this test.
