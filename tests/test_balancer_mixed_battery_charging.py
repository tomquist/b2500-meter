"""Tests for issue #338: mixed DC + AC batteries under solar surplus.

Scenario from the report (users c00LhaNd86 and Matze6989): a Marstek
Venus (can charge **and** discharge via AC) runs next to a Marstek
B2500 (a DC battery — discharges via AC, but cannot charge via AC at
all).  Both report to the same AstraMeter CT002 emulator fed by a
Shelly Pro 3EM.  Under solar surplus the Venus stayed in standby
indefinitely; pointing the Marstek app directly at the Shelly made the
Venus charge immediately.  Discharging, where the B2500 can
participate, worked fine.

Root cause: ``LoadBalancer._compute_auto_target`` split the grid
reading evenly across every reporting storage unit (fair-share plus a
``_balance_correction`` that pushed each consumer toward the average
of reported powers).  Neither mechanism knew the B2500 was
charge-blind, so under surplus each battery was told to absorb half
of the real feed-in — often below the Venus's inverter start-up
threshold (~300-500 W), so the Venus never woke up.

Fix: real Marstek batteries advertise their model in the CT002 request
(``Consumer.device_type``).  The only AC-coupled family is the Venus
(prefixes ``HMG`` and ``VNS``).  ``_compute_auto_target`` now excludes
every other reporter from charge distribution under ``grid_total < 0``
and steers them to 0 W; the Venus receives the full surplus.
Positive grid (discharge) behaviour is unchanged.

The tests here cover:

 * unknown/empty ``device_type`` is now assumed AC-coupled (issue #425
   device-capabilities model; the former fail-closed-to-DC default was
   intentionally dropped),
 * the fix path with recognised Venus / B2500 prefixes,
 * discharge unaffected,
 * the degenerate all-DC-under-surplus case,
 * issue #359: brief negative-grid transients in a pure-DC pool must
   not trigger the charge-blind/steer-to-zero path that exists only
   to protect a co-resident Venus.

    stays off when no AC-chargeable battery is reporting, so the
    fair-share path handles the transient with a small (~-8 W) trim.
