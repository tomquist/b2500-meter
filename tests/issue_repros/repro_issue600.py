"""Reproduction for issue #600 — a once-saturated battery never gets back in.

The report: a battery that was briefly unable to produce (empty, or in an app
mode that ignores the CT) is marked saturated, and from then on it is only ever
handed a token target of a few tens of watts — 16-30 W in the reporters' logs —
which is *below what the device can physically execute*.  It therefore produces
nothing, which is exactly what keeps it marked saturated.  The house imports
kilowatts next to an idle, healthy battery, for hours.

The mechanism is a feedback loop between two parts of the balancer that are each
reasonable alone:

  * fair share scales every consumer's slice by ``1 - saturation``
    (``_compute_auto_target``), so a fully saturated battery is handed ~1% of the
    grid error, and
  * :class:`~astrameter.ct002.balancer.SaturationTracker` counts a poll as
    "failed to follow" whenever the command was at least
    ``MIN_TARGET_FOR_SATURATION`` (20 W) and the battery produced less than that.

Together they have a *stable fixed point at a command of ~MIN_TARGET_FOR_SATURATION*:
if the score decays, the share grows, the command crosses 20 W, and the rise term
(``saturation_alpha`` = 0.15/s) slams the score back up ~30x faster than the decay
(``saturation_decay_factor`` = 0.995/s) can bleed it off.  So the command parks
just around 20-30 W for any shortfall the rest of the pool cannot cover, however
large that shortfall is — see PART A.

For a battery whose minimum actionable command is higher than that the state is
permanent: a B2500's firmware clamps its own command to at least ``pmin``
(80 W with the common inverter, 40 W with the other class), and a stopped unit
only restarts once the grid import reaches that figure, so it is asked for 22 W
forever and answers 0 W forever.  Nothing rescues it:
``MIN_EFFICIENT_POWER = 0`` (the default) disables rotation and probing entirely,
and a restart only re-runs the same trap.
