"""Control-quality verdict: is the loop holding the grid at zero?

The tracker is the one balancer diagnostic aimed at a user rather than at a
maintainer, so these tests are written as the situations it has to name: a
settled loop, one that is off target, and a pack with nothing left to give.
The cases that pin *what it refuses to claim* matter just as much — see
``ControlQualityVerdict`` for why no verdict names a cause.
