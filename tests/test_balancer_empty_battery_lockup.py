"""Regression: balancer cycles forever between two empty batteries while
healthy ones sit permanently deprioritized.

Reported in issue #230 (user kiss81): four phase-A consumers, sustained
~800 W load, and ``MIN_EFFICIENT_POWER`` high enough that only one
active slot is used.  The two alphabetically-first consumers are "empty"
(inverter caps output at 0 W regardless of the target) and the two
alphabetically-later consumers are "full" (follow their target).

Before the fix, ``_reject_probe`` reinserted the just-rejected candidate
near the front of the deprioritized section, so ``_maybe_force_swap_saturated``
kept re-picking the same battery.  At the same time the rejection
updated ``_last_rotation``, which suppressed scheduled rotation for a
full ``efficiency_rotation_interval``.  The result: the two empty
batteries swapped back and forth forever and the full batteries never
got probed.

This test drives :class:`LoadBalancer.compute_target` directly via a
:class:`_FakeClock` harness (same style as
``tests/test_balancer_probe_lockup.py``) and asserts that at least one
of the two full batteries appears in the active set for >= 50% of the
final 600 ticks.
