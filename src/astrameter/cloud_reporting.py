"""Opt-in Marstek HTTP cloud reporting (``hamedata.com``).

A real CT002 (``HME-4``) / CT003 (``HME-3``) periodically reports to the Marstek
cloud over **plain HTTP GET** (no TLS, no token/signature — the device is
identified only by the cleartext ``id``/``aid`` query params). It:

1. runs a one-shot **handshake** ``getDateInfoeu.php`` (``uid``/``fcv``/``aid``/
   ``sv``) — really a device upsert that writes ``aid``→the record's ``type``
   and ``sv``→its ``version``, so we send the CT model and firmware version,
   then
2. sends a **timer-driven** ``setCtReporting`` GET carrying the live grid power,
   the per-bucket charge/discharge split, link state and an incrementing
   ``timeNo``.

The two URL templates here match what each model sends on the wire (see
``docs/marstek-mqtt-http.md``). The field **set is model-dependent**: ``HME-4``
(a clamp) also sends instantaneous voltage / current (``va/vb/vc``, ``ia/ib/ic``)
and 32-bit energy; ``HME-3`` (a smart-meter reader) sends 64-bit energy and
**no** V/I, and has an on-wire quirk — a missing ``&`` between ``slv`` and
``udp`` (``…&slv=<n>udp=<n>…``) — which we reproduce so the request matches a
real device.

This is **opt-in** and best-effort: reporting failures are logged and never
disturb the UDP control loop. Several values a real device measures are not
available to AstraMeter (cumulative energy, and V/I on ``HME-4``); those default
to ``0`` unless supplied. The exact real-world report **cadence** and the server
**response contract** are not known — see the docs.
