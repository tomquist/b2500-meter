"""Keep credentials off the wire, in both directions.

The dashboard has to show a config that contains passwords, tokens and
broker URIs.  Rather than trust the transport, every secret is replaced with
a sentinel on the way out; a value that comes back still equal to the
sentinel means "keep what is stored".  Plaintext credentials therefore never
cross the wire in either direction.

The key patterns mirror what the add-on already redacts from the
add-on log, so the two agree on what counts as a secret.
