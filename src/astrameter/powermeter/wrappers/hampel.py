class HampelPowermeter(PowermeterWrapper):
    """Rolling-median outlier filter for sum-of-phases power readings.

    Maintains a rolling window of the most recent ``window`` totals. When the
    next total lies more than ``n_sigma * 1.4826 * MAD`` away from the window
    median (with a floor of ``min_threshold`` watts to handle the constant-
    signal MAD=0 degenerate case), the sample is treated as an outlier: the
    reported total is replaced by the median and per-phase values are
    redistributed proportionally (equal split when ``|raw_total|`` is too
    small to scale from — see :attr:`MAX_SCALE_RATIO`).

    **The window always holds the raw totals**, including rejected ones. That
    is what the canonical Hampel identifier does, and it is what lets the
    filter follow a real change: writing the median back over a rejected
    sample instead makes the window converge to a constant, drives MAD to
    zero and pins the threshold at ``min_threshold``, after which a sustained
    change (solar arriving, an oven switching on) is rejected indefinitely
    rather than for a few samples. A spike sits in the window for ``window``
    samples, which is precisely what a median is robust to.

    Operates on the sum of phases, mirroring :class:`SmoothedPowermeter`.
    A phase-cancelling outlier (e.g. +1000 W on L1 and -1000 W on L2) is
    therefore invisible to this filter; that is acceptable because every
    downstream wrapper (EMA, deadband, PID) also operates on sum-of-phases.
