"""The connect/read/reconnect loop the WebSocket-fed power sources share.

Home Assistant and the HomeWizard P1 dongle both push measurements over a
WebSocket that has to be reconnected for the life of the process. Everything
that is the same either way — owning the session and the reader task, closing
one message type on another, logging the drop and backing off — lives here, so
a fix to one source cannot leave the other behind.
