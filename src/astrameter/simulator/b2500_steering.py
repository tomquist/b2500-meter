"""Marstek B2500 (HMJ/HMA/HMK) DC-output steering controller.

The B2500 is **DC-coupled**: it has no AC inverter of its own and no wire to
tell one what to do. It feeds one or two external microinverters through their
PV inputs, so the only thing it can do is *pretend to be a solar panel* whose
maximum-power point sits at the wattage it wants to deliver, and let the
microinverter's own tracker find it. Everything below follows from that.

There are two loops, at very different rates:

* **Every 500 ms**, a device-wide integrator turns the CT meter reading into a
  total commanded power ``setpoint``::

      setpoint = clamp(setpoint + gain * grid, pmin_eff, pmax_eff)

  ``gain`` is 1, or **2** while neither output is drawing current (and the unit
  is not in single-output mode). Note the lower clamp: the command is not
  merely *ignored* below ``pmin`` — it can never be *formed* below it.
* **Every 2 ms**, the total is split across the channels, each channel solves
  its synthetic panel curve against the microinverter's present operating point
  and writes a current reference. That inner loop is far faster than any
  balancer poll, so this module models it as "the channel reaches its target
  after the firmware's own dwell" rather than instant.

Two gates decide whether the 500 ms integrator advances at all:

* it steps immediately once the measured output is within **±9 W** of the
  command;
* otherwise it waits ``adjust_time`` seconds (default 6), then **re-seeds the
  command from the measured output** before integrating — so a command the
  hardware cannot reach is pulled back to reality rather than winding up.

And one gate can stop it entirely: **while neither channel is producing, the
integrator does not run**. A stopped unit restarts through a separate check
that needs the grid import to reach ``pmin`` before it will command anything —
which is why a small steady import can leave a B2500 sitting at zero
indefinitely, the observable behind issue #600.

SOC and temperature are handled by a *separate* BMS (charge-current derating,
cell-voltage limits) and are **not** part of this steering loop.

----------
Read out of ``HMJ-2`` V118 (`tomquist/hm2500
<https://github.com/tomquist/hm2500>`_), which loads at ``0x08000000`` — its
vector table admits no other base. Two independent analyses agree on the law,
the rates and the thresholds; where they differed (the inverter-``id`` bands),
the disassembly was re-read directly.

=================================  ==============  ==========================

The channel state machine has five states, and **states 3 and 4 are dead
code**: no instruction in the image ever writes state 3, and the only writer of
state 4 sits inside state 3. State 4 is the ±10 W hold band with a ±100 mA
trim — the loop this module used to be built on, which never runs. The
reachable path is ``0 -> 1 -> 2`` and then state 2 forever, restarting at 0
whenever the target changes.

Not modelled, deliberately: the device also has a second grid loop — a
perturb-and-observe search used when **no** networked meter is configured
(``0x08008a50``). AstraMeter is a networked meter, so the integrator above is
the path that runs. There is also a second per-channel controller
(``0x0800cb88``) selected when the inverter ``id`` falls in ``[1500, 2000)``.
