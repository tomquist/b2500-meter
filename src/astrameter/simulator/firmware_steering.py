"""Marstek HMG-50 self-consumption steering controller.

This reproduces the closed-loop control law a real Marstek HMG-50 (Venus C)
battery runs on the grid value it reads back from the CT: a gain-scheduled,
accelerating step that drives the selected grid power toward zero, preceded by
the device's input-conditioning gate (a >50 W spike filter, a ±20 W deadband
and a small-import hold). It is the steering law documented in
``docs/ct002-ct003-protocol.md`` ("Steering / ramp logic"); the gain table and
per-step arithmetic, and the gate thresholds and ordering, are the exact values
the HMG-50 firmware uses.

**This law is almost certainly not the one your HMG-50 runs.** The firmware
carries two, and picks between them on a model code it parses out of the CT
meter's greeting: it takes the ramp below only when that code is ``1``, the
"no model suffix" fallback, and takes the integer integrator
(:mod:`astrameter.simulator.venus_integer_steering`) for every meter it
recognises. AstraMeter announces itself as ``HME-4`` (``ct002.py``), which is
not code 1, so a real HMG-50 driven by AstraMeter runs the integer law and
never reaches the gain table. The selector is a single ``cmp #1`` at
file+0x20b8e; the model code is written by the CT002 parser's string-compare
chain at file+0x24344. :class:`BatterySimulator` routes HMG-50 devices
accordingly; this module is kept because the code-1 path is real, and because
its gain table is the thing that distinguishes an HMG-50 image from a Venus one.

Scope: the gain table and ramp arithmetic here are the **HMG-50** (Venus C)
ones, and they are HMG-50-*only*. No other Venus runs this law: the VNSA-0,
VNSD-0 and VNSE3-0 firmwares contain none of the gain-table constants and share
an integer integrator behind a gate of their own (a tighter ±10 W deadband and
a one-shot spike filter), modelled in
:mod:`astrameter.simulator.venus_integer_steering`.

That shared law is ``setpoint += (ctrl_ratio/100)*g - 5 W``, clamped to the
configured charge/discharge limits and then parked near zero — inside +/-11 W
for a Venus alone on its bucket, or the HMG-50's own wider bound. Neither this
controller nor its GOLDEN vectors model it. See
``docs/ct002-ct003-protocol.md`` ("Model scope").

Open questions from the 2026-08 firmware audit
----------------------------------------------
Two independent analyses of HMG-50 v156 (plus a direct check of the registers)
disagree with this model on two points. Neither is fixed here, because both
need the sign mapping below resolved first — this module stores the firmware's
setpoint **negated** (see Conventions), so the firmware's direction counter
does not map onto ``ramp`` one-for-one, and a naive edit inverts the loop.

Code sites are **file offsets** into the v156 Control ``.bin``. Like the Venus
images it is an app flashed above the bootloader, so it loads at ``0x08002800``
rather than ``0x08000000``: the reset vector reads ``0x08002ab1`` (file+0x2b0),
and that base is also the one that makes pointer literals resolve to strings
(113 hits, against at most 12 at any other alignment). Runtime address = file
offset + ``0x08002800``.

* **Reversal target.** On a rising grid the firmware stores ``-1`` when its
  counter is positive and ``+1`` otherwise (``movs r6,#1`` at +0x1e290,
  ``mov.w r2,#-1`` at +0x1e3ce, stored at +0x1e420/+0x1e424; same shape at the
  lower rail, +0x1e400). This module stores ``-1`` or ``0``. Under the negated
  convention the firmware's ``+1`` most likely corresponds to ``-1`` here, which
  would shift the first step from ``GAIN[0]`` to ``GAIN[-1]`` (50.23 -> 50.12 W)
  — small, but a real divergence.
* **The spike filter is a one-shot.** The firmware latches a flag
  (+0x1bc7a/+0x1bc84) so the sample after a skipped one is forced through,
  bypassing the deadband and small-import hold as well; at most every other
  sample can be suppressed. :meth:`_gate` below suppresses indefinitely, and
  ``GATED``'s ``drift_keeps_skipping`` vector encodes that behaviour.

The ``GOLDEN`` / ``GATED`` vectors were generated from this model, not from
firmware traces, so they cannot arbitrate either question — they will need
regenerating alongside whichever fix lands.

Conventions
-----------
``g`` is the grid value to null, **positive = importing** from the grid.
``setpoint`` is the commanded inverter power, **positive = charge, negative =
discharge** (so a positive import drives the setpoint negative → discharge).
``hi`` / ``lo`` are the charge / discharge power limits (``hi`` positive,
``lo`` negative); the absolute hardware clamp is ±2500 W.

The arithmetic is done in IEEE-754 single precision (the device has a 32-bit
FPU), so :func:`_f32` rounds after each operation to match the device
bit-for-bit.
