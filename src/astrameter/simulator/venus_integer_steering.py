"""Marstek integer self-consumption steering (Venus A/D/E, and the HMG-50).

The AC-coupled Venus units that are not an HMG-50 all run one control law: an
integer proportional integrator behind an input-conditioning gate, one
regulation step per CT response. None of them contains the HMG-50's float
gain-scheduled ramp (:mod:`astrameter.simulator.firmware_steering`).

**The HMG-50 runs this law too**, for every meter it recognises. Its firmware
carries both: it parses a model code out of the meter's greeting and only takes
the float ramp when that code is ``1``, which is the "no model suffix" fallback.
AstraMeter announces itself as ``HME-4``, which the HMG-50's parser maps to a
code of its own, so an HMG-50 steered by AstraMeter runs the integer law below
and never the gain table. Its branch structure is identical to the Venus one;
only the single-unit park (``park_alone``) and the gate's rest deadband
(``deadband``: ±20 W rather than ±10 W) differ.

Per-step law (``g`` = the bucket value to null, positive = importing; ``out`` =
the unit's own measured output, positive = discharging)::

    g = g / nb                                 # share split across the bucket
    if not gate(g, out, nb): return            # spike filter / deadband / hold
    gain = ctrl_ratio / 100                    # 0.30 .. 1.00 (default 1.00)
    if out < 0 or g < 11:
        if out < 1 and g < -10:   setpoint += gain * g
        elif out * g < 0:         setpoint += g
        elif out < 0 and -11 < g < 0:
            setpoint += g - 5
        # else: hold
    else:                         setpoint += gain * g - 5
    setpoint = clamp(setpoint, lo, hi)         # discharge / charge envelope
    if abs(setpoint) < park_sp and g < park_g: # 11/11 alone, 15/15 shared
        setpoint = 0

``setpoint`` is the commanded inverter power in the device's own convention:
**positive = discharge**, negative = charge. ``hi`` is the discharge limit
(positive), ``lo`` the charge limit (negative). The per-step arithmetic runs in
IEEE-754 single precision with truncation toward zero, matching the device's
32-bit FPU, so :func:`_f32` rounds after each operation.

<https://github.com/rweijnen/marstek-firmware-archive>`_ and
`sphings79/marstek-firmware-archiv
<https://github.com/sphings79/marstek-firmware-archiv>`_). Code sites are given
as **file offsets** into the ``.bin``, because the load base is not obvious and
getting it wrong shifts every address by a constant: these are app images that
start with their own vector table but are flashed **above the bootloader**, at
``0x08004800``, not at ``0x08000000``. Two independent checks agree on that
base — the reset vector (``0x08004a71`` in all three, i.e. file+0x270) and a
scan of which base makes the most pointer literals land on the first byte of a
NUL-terminated string (337-344 hits at ``0x08004800``, at most 28 at any other
alignment). Runtime address = file offset + ``0x08004800``.

=======  =====  ==========  ========  =======  ==============

The integrator offsets point at the branch pair that selects the law
(``cmp out,#0`` / ``cmp g,#0xa``) rather than at a function entry, because on
VNSA-0 the law is inlined into a larger routine instead of standing alone. The
RAM addresses come from pointer literals, so they are absolute and unaffected
by the base.

The VNSD-0 and VNSE3-0 routines are the same code instruction for instruction —
integrator, gate and share split alike. **VNSA-0 runs the same gate**: its
prologue matches byte for byte, and disassembling all three side by side, the
routine is identical for its whole length (the only differences are branch
targets and one register allocation). The law is also stable across versions:
it is identical in VNSE3-0 v144/v148/v1476/v150 and VNSD-0 v147/v149/v1492/v150.

Two properties were verified rather than assumed, because they are what
separates these units from a B2500 (:mod:`b2500_steering`):

* **The integrator adds to its own stored setpoint, never to measured output.**
  Every other write to that RAM word is a reset to zero (lost CT, mode change,
  invalid reading). So a command too small for the inverter to execute still
  accumulates — a repeated 30 W reading walks the setpoint 25, 50, 75 W until
  the unit starts. A B2500, whose setpoint is ``measured_output + 0.9 * grid``,
  never can.
* **The float gain table is absent.** None of the eleven HMG-50 gain constants
  appears in any Venus image, while all eleven appear in all ten archived
  HMG-50 images.

Scope: this is the **run mode 10** carve-out. Ahead of everything above, the
routine tests a mode byte and, when it reads 10, hands ``(out, g)`` to a
different function and stores that result to an unrelated RAM word
(``0x20000300``), leaving the steering setpoint untouched. Nothing here
describes that path; the model covers the CT-following modes the balancer
drives.

``out`` is a signed 16-bit field of the device status struct (``+0x18``). Its
identity is inferred, not read: the gate's spike filter tests *"the grid jumped
>50 W while this value barely moved"*, which is only meaningful for the unit's
own output — were it the unit's own grid reading, the two conditions would
contradict each other. The HMG-50 gate has the identical shape around a value
documented as ``out``. The inference is also cheap: at the default
``ctrl_ratio`` the branches it selects differ only by the 5 W step bias.
