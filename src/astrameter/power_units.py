"""What counts as a power reading, and what it takes to get watts from it.

A leaf module on purpose. The powermeter that converts readings and the
dashboard that offers sensors to configure have to agree on this exactly —
when ``MW`` and ``mW`` were added to the converter, the dashboard's own copy
of the list still said "W or kW", so it hid sensors that read perfectly and
flagged a configured one as missing. Neither side keeps its own list now.

It lives outside ``astrameter.powermeter`` because importing anything from
that package runs its ``__init__``, which pulls in every meter and cycles back
through the config loader.
