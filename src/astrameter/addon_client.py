"""Minimal async client for the Home Assistant Supervisor add-on API.

Only the ``/addons/self/*`` endpoints the dashboard needs, so an add-on install
can read and write its own options without the browser ever seeing
``SUPERVISOR_TOKEN``: the token stays here, is sent as a bearer header, and is
never logged nor put into an exception message.

``hassio_role: homeassistant`` is enough for all of these — Supervisor's
security middleware bypasses role checks for single-segment ``/addons/self/<x>``
paths.  Two-segment paths (``/addons/self/options/validate``) are not bypassed
and are deliberately not used.

        which is what ``homeassistant_api: true`` grants — the same route the
        HOMEASSISTANT powermeter already uses.

        "Applicable" is deliberately generous: a `device_class: power` sensor
        is the obvious case, but plenty of real installs expose grid power as
        a plain sensor in a power unit with no device class, and excluding
        those would make the picker useless exactly for the people who need
        it. Unavailable entities are kept — a sensor can be briefly
        unavailable at add-on start and still be the right choice.

        The unit test is :func:`~astrameter.power_units.is_power_unit`, shared
        with the powermeter rather than a list kept here: when MW and mW were
        added there this one still said "W or kW", so the picker hid sensors
        that read perfectly and flagged a configured one as "not found in Home
        Assistant".

        A `device_class: power` entity whose unit is *not* readable is still
        offered — a template sensor mislabelled `power` is a common mistake,
        and hiding it only makes the entity the user is looking for vanish —
        but it is marked ``readable: False`` so the picker can say why rather
        than let it fail on every read once chosen.

        The domain is not part of the test.  Readings are fetched per entity
        from ``/api/states/<entity_id>``, which does not care what domain the
        id is in, so a `number.` or `input_number.` entity carrying watts is a
        working configuration — and filtering to `sensor.` told those users
        their entity was "not found in Home Assistant" while it was feeding
        the controller perfectly well.
