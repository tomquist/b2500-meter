description: Adds a grid powermeter backend end to end: the module, the config-loader factory, the web editor and generator entries, the ESPHome equivalent, both doc sets and the tests. Use when adding support for a new energy meter or smart-meter source, or renaming an existing one.

# Adding a powermeter

Powermeters are Python-only and have **no** C++/ESPHome counterpart — the
ESPHome component reads grid power from any native ESPHome sensor instead — so
the parity rule doesn't apply here. A new meter still touches several places
beyond the implementation; grep an existing one (`HomeWizard` / `HOMEWIZARD`) to
find every spot, and work through all eight so the config loader, web editor,
generator and both doc sets stay in sync.

1. **Implementation** — `powermeter/<module>.py` with a class implementing
   `get_powermeter_watts()`. Pick the base by how readings arrive:

   - **Polled over HTTP** — `HttpPowermeter` (`powermeter/http_client.py`). It
     owns the session lifecycle and a `get_json(url)` that fails fast and
     raises on an HTTP error, so a backend only builds URLs and decodes bodies.
   - **Pushed to you** — `PushPowermeter` (`powermeter/base.py`). Set
     `_message_event` on every measurement received and it implements both wait
     methods for you. Don't subclass plain `Powermeter` for a push source: the
     control loop asks for a *fresh* reading through `wait_for_next_message()`,
     whose base default is a no-op, so it would be handed a stale one.
   - **Anything else** — `Powermeter`, overriding the waits only if its no-op
     defaults are wrong for the source.
2. **Exports** — the import and `__all__` entry in `powermeter/__init__.py`.
3. **Config loader** — in `config/config_loader.py`: import the class, define a
   `*_SECTION` string, add a `create_*_powermeter()` factory reading the
   section's options, and register the pair in `_FACTORIES` (matched
   longest-prefix-first, so ordering is not a hazard). Pass an optional key
   through `_declared(...)` so the class's own default applies when the key is
   unset, rather than restating it. `POWER_OFFSET`, `POWER_MULTIPLIER`,
   `THROTTLE_INTERVAL` and `NETMASK` are handled globally for any section that
   returns a powermeter.
4. **Web config editor** — the section's typed keys in `SECTION_KEY_TYPES`
   (`src/astrameter/web_config.py`) via the `_pm(...)` helper, listing only the
   non-default types (`password`, `boolean`, `integer`).
5. **Web config generator** — a `POWERMETERS` entry in `web/ts/schema.ts`:
   fields, `docPython`, and an `esphome` spec describing how the same source is
   read on an ESP32 (`kind` / `tier` plus any `haEntity`, `url1`, `lambda1`,
   `warn`). Run `cd web && npm run check`.
6. **ESPHome docs** — even without a C++ port, document how to read the *same
   source* on an ESP32 in `docs/esphome-powermeters.md`: a tier section (🟢
   native / 🔵 generic HTTP / 🟠 alternate via HA, Modbus or MQTT / 🔴 not yet)
   **and** its entry in the Contents legend, consistent with step 5's `esphome`
   spec.
7. **Examples, docs and changelog** — a commented example in
   `config.ini.example`, a subsection **and** Contents entry in
   `docs/powermeters.md`, the meter in `README.md`'s supported-source list, and
   one `## Next` bullet in `CHANGELOG.md`.
8. **Tests** — `powermeter/<module>_test.py` and a `create_*_powermeter` factory
   test in `config/config_loader_test.py`.
