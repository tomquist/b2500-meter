"""ESPHome external component: CT002/CT003 grid-meter emulator.

Ports `src/astrameter/ct002/` (Python) to a native ESPHome component. Parent
schema accepts grid-power sensor IDs and the cross-phase filter pipeline
(Hampel/smoothing/deadband/PID). Optional sub-blocks under the same
`ct002:` key:

* `mqtt_insights:` — publish Home Assistant Device Discovery + answer
  Marstek-app polls on the local broker. Requires an upstream `mqtt:`
  block in YAML.
* `marstek_registration:` — register a managed CT002/CT003 with the
  Marstek cloud on first boot; persist the MAC via ESPPreferences;
  apply it to this `ct002:` so UDP responses + MQTT topics use the
  cloud-side identity. Requires an upstream `http_request:` block.
* `dashboard:` — serve AstraMeter's live status dashboard from the ESP32
  itself. On by default (ESP32 only); `dashboard: false` leaves it out of
  the firmware entirely, and the block is only needed to change an option.
