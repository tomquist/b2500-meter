# Agent notes

The rules that apply to every change are below. Procedures for one area —
CT002 parity, the dashboard build, the steering evaluation, config options,
adding a powermeter — are skills in `.agents/skills/`, each a plain `SKILL.md`
you can read directly. Keep all of it true: when a change makes something here
or in a skill wrong, fix it in the same change.

## Verify

Resolved versions live in **`uv.lock`**. Install dev dependencies the way CI
does, then run what CI runs (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run ruff format . && uv run ruff check . && uv run mypy src/ && uv run pytest
```

Each skill names the extra suite its area needs and how to get it running in a
sandbox. Don't report a suite as skipped without trying.

## Python ↔ ESPHome parity (REQUIRED)

`esphome/components/ct002/` is a mechanical C++ mirror of the Python CT002
stack: filenames, symbol names and filter ordering all match. Any change to
shared behavior lands on **both** sides in the same change, verified by `uv run
pytest tests/components/ct002/`. `CONTRIBUTING.md` maps file to file; the
`check-ct002-parity` skill has what is mirrored, what is deliberately waived,
and what the firmware constrains.

## Branches and pull requests

Open pull requests against **`develop`**, never `main` — tooling offers `main`
as the base, so set it yourself. `main` takes release merges and maintainer
hotfixes only, and `.github/workflows/pr-base-guard.yml` exempts maintainers, so
nothing will catch it for you. GitHub reads that workflow and
`.github/pull_request_template.md` from the **default branch**, so edits to
either do nothing until they reach `main` at the next release.

**Never post a top-level PR comment.** An agent posts under the maintainer's
account, so it reads as the maintainer pronouncing on their own pull request.
Status updates, verification results and "here's what I changed" summaries
belong in the **PR description**, edited as the work moves. The one place an
agent should write on GitHub is a **review thread**, to argue that a finding is
wrong — a finding you accept needs no reply, just the fix. Everything else you
say to the person you're working with.

## Branches and pull requests

Open pull requests against **`develop`**, never `main` (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
`main` takes release merges and maintainer hotfixes only — never agent work,
and the guard below exempts maintainers, so nothing will catch it for you.
Tooling offers `main` as the base, so set it yourself;
`.github/workflows/pr-base-guard.yml` retargets what slips through, at the cost
of a round-trip.

GitHub reads that workflow and `.github/pull_request_template.md` from the
**default branch**, so edits to either do nothing until they reach `main` at the
next release.

## Changelog

For user-facing work, keep **exactly one bullet under `## Next`** for *your
change*. The unit is the change, not the branch or PR: a change spanning
several PRs edits that same bullet rather than adding one each. `## Next`
holding several bullets is normal and correct — one per change heading into
the release — but never touch a bullet belonging to a different change. Skip
`CHANGELOG.md` entirely for refactors, tooling and tests-only work.

Write it for the user: the visible problem and outcome, **one sentence of about
30 words**, no implementation details (internal names, config mechanics, parity
notes) unless the user genuinely sets the thing. Add a second sentence only when
they have to *do* something — set a new option, undo a workaround, adapt to a
break. Err on the side of terse.

Append `([#<pr>](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/<pr>))` as soon as
you learn the number, without being asked.
