# Changelog

## Next

- **Fixed** a battery being driven to full charge or discharge against the house for up to a minute after it ran its phase detection, on setups using the optional Hampel outlier filter ([#652](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/652), [#653](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/653)).

- **Fixed** the dashboard staying blank and `/api/status` returning nothing once cloud reporting had sent its first push ([#654](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/654), [#656](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/656)).


## 2.3.0

- **Fixed** batteries resuming automatic charging or discharging when every distribution weight was set to zero; all parked batteries now wind down to zero until their weights are restored ([#646](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/646)).

- **Fixed** a battery set to a lower **Efficiency Window Weight** than its peers barely taking a turn in the low-demand rotation, instead of running proportionally less than them ([#647](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/647), [#648](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/648)). Set it to `0 %` for a battery you want held back whenever the others can cover.

- **Fixed** an unavailable ESPHome native power sensor continuing to report its old reading as healthy while connected, leaving batteries steering against stale grid power until the sensor recovered ([#645](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/645)).

- **Fixed** HomeWizard meters reading 0 W, leaving batteries idle, on grid connections whose meter reports a correct total but publishes no per-phase power (three-phase without neutral, common in Belgium). The total is now used when every phase reads zero ([#650](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/650)).

- **Fixed** a Home Assistant power source refusing to start, or reading as permanently unavailable, when its entity list had a stray or trailing comma (`POWER_INPUT_ALIAS = sensor.import,`). Blank entries are now ignored ([#640](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/640)).

- **Fixed** a B2500 written off as unable to deliver after being handed a share too small to switch it on, which made every later share smaller still — leaving it at 0 W indefinitely while the house imported ([#624](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/624), [#629](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/629)).

- **Fixed** B2500 batteries sitting at 0 W under active control while the whole house load was imported: the command they were sent could never exceed what the battery needs to start, and a battery that never starts was never sent more ([#600](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/600), [#614](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/614), [#631](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/631)).

- **Added** Refoss / Meross energy monitors (EM01P, EM06P, EM16P) as a power source (`[REFOSS]` or `[MEROSS]`) ([#598](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/598)).

- **Breaking:** **removed** the per-battery **Last Seen** sensor — it changed on every poll and buried the Home Assistant logbook under one entry per second. Automations that used it should switch to the battery's entities going *unavailable*, or to `last_reported`; see [docs/mqtt-insights.md](docs/mqtt-insights.md#is-a-battery-still-reporting-home-assistant) ([#576](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/576), [#597](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/597)).

- **Added** a **control quality** reading — stable, off target, or limited by full/empty batteries — that says whether AstraMeter is actually holding your grid at zero, as Home Assistant sensors and on the dashboard. See [docs/ct002.md](docs/ct002.md#control-quality) ([#599](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/599)).

- **Fixed** the per-battery **Phase** sensor staying empty, and the Home Assistant log filling with "invalid option" warnings, for batteries in combined / whole-home mode ([#580](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/580), [#596](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/596)).

- **Changed** the CT002/CT003 **Poll Interval** sensor to count every poll a battery sends rather than only the ones AstraMeter answered, and **added** an **Answer Interval** sensor for the reply rate. The two are identical until you set `DEDUPE_TIME_WINDOW`, which is exactly when you need both to tell a battery that slowed down apart from one that is simply being answered less often. A battery whose polls that window suppresses is also no longer at risk of being dropped as if it had gone silent. The dashboard and the ESPHome component report the same pair ([#589](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/589), [#591](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/591)).

- **Fixed** the optional **Hampel outlier filter** (`HAMPEL_WINDOW`) freezing your grid reading permanently. After any lasting change in the house — solar arriving, an oven switching on — the filter treated every later reading as an outlier and kept reporting the value from before the change, for as long as AstraMeter ran, leaving the batteries steering against a stale number. It now holds a real change back only until enough readings agree (about half the window), while still rejecting genuine spikes. Also fixed wildly wrong per-phase values when the total briefly passed near zero. Affects both the Python service and the ESPHome component ([#587](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/587)).

- **Added** a **live status dashboard**: one page showing grid power, your batteries, power-source health and — when AstraMeter is steering them — each battery's target and the balancer's internal state, plus the ability to change your configuration and steer individual batteries without editing files. On by default and able to change things: in the Home Assistant add-on it opens from the sidebar, and running AstraMeter yourself it is at `http://<host>:52500/`. That address has no login of its own, so set `DASHBOARD_ALLOW_WRITE = False` for a read-only page, `WEB_CONFIG_ENABLED = False` to keep only the configuration out of it, or `DASHBOARD_ENABLED = False` to serve nothing but the health check. Open it by IP address, `localhost`, a `.local` or a `.home.arpa` name; any other name — a reverse proxy, or a router-assigned one such as `astrameter.fritz.box` — is refused until you add it to `DASHBOARD_ALLOWED_HOSTS`. See [docs/dashboard.md](docs/dashboard.md) ([#577](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/577), [#604](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/604), [#615](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/615), [#617](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/617), [#618](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/618)).

- **Added** the same **live status dashboard to the ESPHome component**, served by the ESP32 itself at `http://<device>/` with no configuration at all, showing grid power, every battery and the balancer's state. If you already use ESPHome's `web_server:`, the page moves to `http://<device>/astrameter/` and ESPHome's own page gains a link to it. Add `controls: true` under `dashboard:` to steer batteries from the page, or `dashboard: false` to leave it out of the firmware; see [docs/dashboard.md](docs/dashboard.md#esphome-on-an-esp32) ([#605](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/605), [#606](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/606), [#607](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/607)).
- **Added** the **ESPHome native API** as a power source (`[ESPHOMENATIVE]`): AstraMeter reads power data from an esphome device via the native API. This should be more performant than the polling mechanism of the ESPHOME component. The sensor's declared unit is respected, so a kW sensor is converted to watts rather than read as ~0 W. See [docs/powermeters.md](docs/powermeters.md#esphomenative) ([#566](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/566))
- **Fixed** grid-power sources reporting in kilowatts being silently misread as watts, which made typical household readings round to ~0 W and left batteries idle with no error anywhere. Both the ESPHome component and the Home Assistant powermeter now respect the sensor's declared unit: kW (and MW/mW) values are converted to watts automatically, a sensor with a non-power unit (e.g. °C or kWh) is rejected with an explicit error, and the ESPHome firmware warns when an undeclared-unit sensor's readings look like kilowatts. If you previously worked around this with a manual ×1000 multiplier on a kW sensor, remove it — the value would now be scaled twice ([#39](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/39), [#572](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/572), [#573](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/573)).
- **Fixed** **Tibber Pulse** readings frequently dropping with connection-timeout errors because the bridge's slow webserver couldn't answer within the old hardcoded 1-second connection limit: the default timeout is now a more forgiving 5 seconds and can be tuned with a new `TIMEOUT` option ([#551](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/551), [#565](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/565)).
- **Fixed** active control silently breaking until a restart after a single invalid grid reading (a NaN value, e.g. from a briefly unavailable ESPHome sensor or a glitchy meter source): the controller could get stuck sending every battery a small constant discharge command regardless of the actual grid. An invalid reading is now treated like an unavailable meter — batteries hold their output for that poll and normal control resumes with the next good reading ([#548](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/548), [#550](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/550)).
- **Fixed** HTTP-polled power sources hiding a device's HTTP error behind a confusing decode failure, and an `[MQTT*]` power source refusing to start when a connection field was left blank ([#636](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/636)).

## 2.2.4

- **Fixed** the CT002/CT003 and Shelly Pro 3EM emulators answering a battery several times in quick succession — instead of once — whenever a reading was delayed (with `WAIT_FOR_NEXT_MESSAGE` enabled, a throttled meter via `THROTTLE_INTERVAL`, or any slow power source). The battery acts on each reply relative to its current output, so the burst fed it the same stale correction repeatedly and could push it well past the intended setpoint. Batteries polling during a delayed reading now get exactly one reply per reading ([#542](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/542)).


## 2.2.3

- **Fixed** Marstek batteries running in combined / whole-home mode (newer firmware, no per-phase assignment) missing all their per-battery Home Assistant entities — Distribution Weight, Manual/Auto Target, Active and Min DC Output never appeared, so per-battery balancing couldn't be controlled. These batteries are now recognized as a valid, actively-steered mode: their entities show up and fair distribution applies to them like any phase-assigned battery ([#536](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/discussions/536), [#537](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/537)).
- **Fixed** the generated ESPHome config for HTTP-polled meters (notably the **Fronius Smart Meter**) not reading the grid, which left the battery uncontrolled until the config was hand-edited. It now works as generated ([#534](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/discussions/534), [#535](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/535)).


## 2.2.2

- **Added** the CT002/CT003 active-control and balancing tuning options (ramp pacing, fair distribution, grid prediction, oscillation damping, steady-import trim and more) to the Home Assistant add-on, so they can be changed from the add-on UI instead of a hand-edited config file ([#527](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/527)).
- **Fixed** uneven charging/discharging across multiple batteries sharing a phase (e.g. two Marstek Venus E3 where one sat at ~88 W while the other took ~890 W and never equalized), a regression in 2.2.0. The steady-state deadband optimization now steps aside whenever the batteries are actually out of balance, so they're pulled back to an even split instead of staying lopsided ([#523](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/523), [#526](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/526)).
- **Fixed** a full or empty battery not handing its load over to a healthy one under fair distribution when `PACE_BASE_STEP` was set below `MIN_TARGET_FOR_SATURATION` (e.g. 15 vs the default 20), which left part of the surplus imported or exported instead of absorbed ([#522](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/522), [#529](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/529)).
- **Fixed** the per-battery **Manual Target** and **Auto Target** controls (and the other per-battery settings) resetting to their defaults on their own — both after an AstraMeter restart and after a battery briefly dropped offline. Your override now survives a restart (it's re-applied once the battery is ready) and an eviction (it's remembered and re-applied when the battery returns) ([#520](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/discussions/520), [#531](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/531)).
- **Fixed** **SML** meters (both the **Tibber Pulse** and serial **`[SML]`** sources) reporting incorrectly scaled power readings for some meters, which previously needed a manual workaround to correct ([#519](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/519), [#521](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/521)).
- **Fixed** **Tibber Pulse** logging frequent `Could not decode SML telegram` warnings; occasional unreadable updates from the bridge are now tolerated quietly ([#518](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/518), [#521](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/521)).


## 2.2.1

- **Fixed** the Home Assistant add-on failing to start on 2.2.0 — it exited immediately on every launch (looping with no log output) for anyone not using a custom config file. Updating to this version restores normal startup ([#510](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/510), [#511](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/511), [#513](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/513)).


## 2.2.0

- **Added** opt-in, **experimental** **HTTP cloud reporting** for the CT002/CT003 emulator (Python and ESPHome): when enabled, AstraMeter periodically pushes live readings to Marstek's cloud (`hamedata.com`) the way a real CT does. Off by default and marked experimental — how (and whether) the data surfaces in the Marstek app isn't fully confirmed yet. See [docs/marstek-mqtt-http.md](docs/marstek-mqtt-http.md#6-http-cloud-reporting-both-models) ([#500](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/500), [#506](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/506), [#507](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/507)).
- **Improved** active control. Several changes keep the grid closer to zero (less import/export, overshoot and hunting) and let multi-battery setups settle faster with less setpoint churn: per-battery commands are ramp-paced and oscillation-damped; an adaptive grid predictor compensates for meters that report with a delay (e.g. a Home Assistant push sensor); a steady-import trim covers the few watts of load the battery firmware's input deadband leaves importing; a near-zero grid error in a multi-battery setup is handed to a single battery so it clears that deadband; and efficiency mode no longer moves a battery in and out of the pool on noisy load. On by default; tune or disable via `GRID_PREDICT_TRUST`, `IMPORT_TRIM_W`, `CONCENTRATE_DEADBAND`, `PACE_BASE_STEP` / `PACE_MAX_STEP`, `OSC_DAMP_*` and `EFFICIENCY_DEMAND_ALPHA` (lowercase on ESPHome). The balance deadband default changed from 15 W to 25 W ([#458](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/458), [#469](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/469), [#473](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/473)).
- **Added** a per-battery **Efficiency Window Weight** control (Home Assistant, Python and ESPHome): sets how much of the balancer's low-demand efficiency rotation each battery takes — `100 %` full, `0 %` to skip it, in between for less active time. Separate from **Distribution Weight**.
- **Added** an **Active Control** switch on the CT002/CT003 device in Home Assistant (Python and ESPHome), plus a matching option in the add-on's Configuration tab and the web config generator, so you can fall back to relay mode without hand-editing a config file. Defaults on; the choice is retained across restarts (it replaces the previous read-only status sensor).
- **Added** the AVM **FRITZ!Smart Energy 250** smart-meter read head as a power source (`[FRITZ]`): AstraMeter reads its signed grid power from the FRITZ!Box over the AHA-HTTP interface — positive = import, negative = feed-in. See [docs/powermeters.md](docs/powermeters.md#fritzsmart-energy-250).
- **Added** the **Fronius Smart Meter** as a power source (`[FRONIUS]`): AstraMeter reads grid power through a Fronius inverter's local Solar API — positive = import, negative = feed-in — with optional per-phase (L1/L2/L3) readings via `PER_PHASE`. See [docs/powermeters.md](docs/powermeters.md#fronius-smart-meter) ([#499](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/499)).
- **Added** the **Tibber Pulse** as a power source (`[TIBBER_PULSE]`): AstraMeter reads it locally through the Pulse Bridge — decoding the meter's SML telegram with no Tibber cloud involved — including per-phase readings. See [docs/powermeters.md](docs/powermeters.md#tibber-pulse) ([#502](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/502)).
- **Added** the **Min DC Output** option to the Home Assistant add-on's Configuration tab and the web config generator, so it no longer requires a custom config file ([#446](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/446)).
- **Changed** the CT002/CT003 emulator to behave more like a real CT: with active control off batteries now see each other's reported power and each takes its 1/N per-phase share, a battery that goes silent drops out after missing ~2 of its own poll cycles instead of a fixed 120 s (set `CONSUMER_TTL` to keep a fixed window), and the optional `participate` field newer batteries (e.g. B2500) send is honored ([#457](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/457), [#460](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/460), [#462](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/462)).
- **Changed** the bundled simulator (`astra-sim`) to model real Marstek steering more faithfully — the gain-scheduled Venus self-consumption controller, a DC-coupled B2500, and a Venus D — and added a steering-evaluation harness (`python -m astrameter.simulator.evaluation`) that CI runs on every PR to catch control-quality regressions.
- **Changed** the **Force Rotation** button on the CT002/CT003 device in Home Assistant to appear only when efficiency rotation is enabled, so it's no longer shown when it would have nothing to do ([#495](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/495)).
- **Fixed** the per-battery **AstraMeter Consumer** device in Home Assistant getting merged into the battery's own device (e.g. from hm2mqtt), so its controls and sensors landed on the wrong device. The merge depended on MQTT discovery order, which is why it hit only some batteries ([#438](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/438)).
- **Fixed** the web config generator producing invalid ESPHome YAML for HTTP/JSON power sources (e.g. HomeWizard P1, Shelly, Tasmota), which ESPHome rejected with `Cannot have two actions in one item` ([#477](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/477)).
- **Fixed** the HomeWizard powermeter's MQTT Insights **Online** sensor flapping while the P1 meter is in a broken state replaying a stale cached reading; the source is now reported online only while fresh readings keep flowing ([#427](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/427)).


## 2.1.2

- **Added** a **Min DC Output** option that keeps a DC battery's inverter (e.g. the Marstek B2500) from switching off at 0 W and falling asleep under high PV surplus. Set it globally (`MIN_DC_OUTPUT`) or per battery from Home Assistant; off by default ([#425](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/425)).
- **Fixed** a phantom empty "Unnamed Device" that kept reappearing under the MQTT integration in Home Assistant, even after deleting it. AstraMeter now publishes a proper top-level **AstraMeter** device — with **Status**, **Version**, and **Consumer Count** entities — that the meter devices are grouped under. The hub is now published in standalone/Docker too (keyed on a base-topic fallback when `ADDON_SLUG` isn't set), so devices group there as well ([#421](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/421)).
- **Fixed** batteries drifting or losing their phase reference during a brief power-meter dropout (e.g. a Home Assistant sensor going `unavailable`). The CT002/CT003 emulator now sends a zero adjustment so each battery holds its current output while the meter is down, instead of re-driving control from the last-known reading — which could wind a battery up or feed stale per-phase values into a Venus phase self-diagnosis ([#403](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/403)).
- **Added** a per-powermeter diagnostic device in MQTT Insights: each configured power source gets an "AstraMeter Powermeter `<Section>`" device (grouped under the AstraMeter hub) with an **Online** connectivity sensor that flips off when the source stops delivering fresh, usable readings (a stalled or disconnected push stream, or a polling source whose reads start failing), plus **Power**/**L1**/**L2**/**L3** sensors showing the latest per-phase readings and their total. A phase that merely stops changing stays online; tune or disable the publish cadence with `POWERMETER_HEALTH_INTERVAL` ([#427](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/427)).


## 2.1.1

- **Changed** transient meter-read failures (in the Shelly emulator and the CT002/CT003 emulator, e.g. when an HTTP source times out) now log a single-line warning instead of a full stack trace; the traceback is included only when running at `LOG_LEVEL = DEBUG` ([#404](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/404)).
- **Added** the Hampel outlier filter and PID controller as optional fields in the Home Assistant add-on Configuration tab (alongside the existing smoothing/deadband options) — all optional and off unless you set them. The web config generator gained a "Home Assistant add-on" target that produces a ready-to-paste add-on options block including these filters.
- **Fixed** the power sensors published via MQTT Insights now carry `state_class: measurement`, so the instantly-updated grid/target/reported power entities can be used as power sources in the Home Assistant energy dashboard ([#416](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/416)).
- **Fixed** the ESPHome MQTT Insights `device_id` now defaults to `device-1` (matching the Python add-on) instead of the ESPHome `ct002:` component id, so both stacks publish the same Home Assistant discovery node (e.g. `astrameter_ct002_device-1`). Existing ESPHome users who want to keep their previous device can set `device_id:` explicitly under `mqtt_insights:`.


## 2.1.0

- **Added** a per-battery **Distribution Weight** Home Assistant entity (default `1.0`) that biases how the balancer splits load across multiple batteries — e.g. set `1.5` and `1.0` for a ~60:40 split so a smaller battery no longer saturates first ([#412](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/discussions/412)). The per-battery controls (manual target, auto/active toggles, distribution weight) now each use a dedicated retained MQTT command topic, so Home Assistant restores their values across an AstraMeter restart.
- **Fixed** intermittent CT stalls when an upstream HTTP power meter was slow to respond: the read timeout for the polling HTTP sources (Shelly, AMIS Reader, emlog, ESPHome, ioBroker, generic JSON-HTTP, SHRDZM, Tasmota, VZLogger) is now 2s with a 1s connect timeout (was 10s), so an unresponsive meter fails fast and the next battery poll can recover instead of pinning a request handler ([#404](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/404)).
- **Added** a project website (`web/`, deployable to GitHub Pages): a landing page introducing AstraMeter (features, supported devices and power meters, installation options, FAQ) plus a beginner-friendly config generator that walks you through a few questions and produces a ready-to-use Python `config.ini` or ESPHome YAML, with a live preview, save/load/share, and step-by-step ESPHome flashing guidance ([#399](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/399)).
- **Added** experimental ESPHome external component `ct002` to run the CT002/CT003 emulator directly on an ESP32. See `esphome.example.yaml` and the per-meter grid-power sensor reference in `docs/esphome-powermeters.md` (which also lists meters not yet supported on the ESP, e.g. Enphase Envoy and the SMA Energy Meter). Per-source `config.ini` documentation moved out of the README into `docs/powermeters.md` ([#385](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/385), [#397](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/397)).
- **Added** Modbus UDP support via a `TRANSPORT = TCP|UDP` option in the `[MODBUS]` section (defaults to `TCP`) ([#387](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/387)).
- **Fixed** Home Assistant powermeter timing out on startup with "Timeout waiting for Home Assistant state" when the configured sensor hasn't changed value since AstraMeter started ([#382](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/382), [#383](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/383)).
- **Fixed** `DEVICE_TYPE = shellypro3em_new` (and `shellypro3em_old`) generating an invalid `device-N` source id that the B2500 rejected, so the CT was never detected. These variants now default to a proper `shellypro3em-*` id like the combined `shellypro3em` type ([#389](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/389)).
- **Fixed** multi-Venus setups where a battery passing PV through to the grid (full SoC with "feed excess to grid" enabled) caused other batteries on different phases to stop charging. AstraMeter now populates the CT002 cross-talk `*_chrg_power` / `*_dchrg_power` fields from the per-battery instruction it sent rather than from the battery's reported AC output, so involuntary PV-passthrough no longer looks like a battery discharge to the rest of the fleet ([#376](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/376)).

## 2.0.2

- **Fixed** EMA smoother slowing down across zero-crossings when `SMOOTH_TARGET_ALPHA` was configured above 0.5: the sign-flip "catchup" branch capped the effective alpha at 0.5, which actually reduced responsiveness for users who picked a larger alpha (e.g. 1.0 for near-instant tracking). The catchup boost now never drops below the configured alpha ([#371](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/371)).

## 2.0.1

- **Fixed** false "Home Assistant sensor is stale" errors for sensors that update infrequently or push only on value changes — including constant readings (e.g. solar production at night) and push-based integrations. The Home Assistant powermeter now treats a sensor as stale only when Home Assistant itself marks it `unavailable`/`unknown` or the websocket connection is lost ([#363](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/issues/363)).

## 2.0.0

### Breaking
- **Rebranded** project from "B2500 Meter" to "AstraMeter" (formerly b2500-meter). Package renamed to `astrameter`, CLI commands are now `astrameter` and `astra-sim`. Docker image moved from `ghcr.io/tomquist/b2500-meter` to `ghcr.io/tomquist/astrameter` (the legacy `ghcr.io/tomquist/b2500-meter` image is still published in parallel for backward compatibility). Home Assistant users must update their app repository URL to `https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter#main` ([#302](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/302), [#304](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/304)).
- **Removed CT001 emulation** (Python `ct001` package and the `nodered.json` flow). Use `ct002`/`ct003` for multiple storage devices, or a Shelly `DEVICE_TYPE` otherwise. Drop obsolete `[GENERAL]` options `DISABLE_SUM_PHASES`, `DISABLE_ABSOLUTE_VALUES`, and `POLL_INTERVAL` if present. The Home Assistant app no longer offers `poll_interval` or `disable_absolute_values`; remove those keys from saved app configuration if validation fails after upgrade ([#258](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/258)).
- **Changed Shelly emulator default:** event-driven powermeters (MQTT, SMA Speedwire, HomeWizard WS, HA WS) now block each Shelly response for up to 2 s waiting for a fresh push sample, then fall back to the cached value on timeout. Set `WAIT_FOR_NEXT_MESSAGE = False` under `[GENERAL]` or the powermeter section to restore the previous immediate-read behavior ([#322](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/322), [#330](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/330)).
- **Changed API:** the `Powermeter` base class is now async. Out-of-tree powermeter subclasses must implement `async get_powermeter_watts()`; the synchronous legacy interface has been removed ([#273](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/273), [#274](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/274), [#275](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/275), [#276](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/276), [#277](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/277), [#278](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/278), [#279](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/279), [#282](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/282)).
- **Removed** 32-bit ARM (`armhf` / `armv7`) Home Assistant images. Installations must use a 64-bit Home Assistant OS or supervisor environment (`amd64` or `aarch64`), consistent with Home Assistant dropping 32-bit support.
- **Removed** from-source / contributor workflow: Pipenv, `Pipfile`, and running `python main.py` from the repo root are gone — use **uv** and the **`astrameter`** command (or `uv run astrameter`) per [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Added
- **Added** CT002/CT003 emulation for steering multiple Marstek storage devices over the Marstek CT UDP protocol. Active control is on by default (`ACTIVE_CONTROL = True`): the emulator smooths the grid reading, splits the target across batteries with a 15 W `BALANCE_DEADBAND`, and runs time-weighted saturation detection with handoff — set `ACTIVE_CONTROL = False` for relay mode (raw meter values forwarded, batteries decide). Includes fair-share balancing (`FAIR_DISTRIBUTION`, `BALANCE_GAIN`), manual target override and forced rotation via MQTT, ARP-based consumer discovery, and an opt-in efficiency mode that concentrates power on fewer batteries at low demand (`MIN_EFFICIENT_POWER`, `EFFICIENCY_ROTATION_INTERVAL`, probe-based fades, `SATURATION_GRACE_SECONDS`) ([#283](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/283), [#284](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/284), [#287](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/287), [#289](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/289), [#291](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/291), [#293](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/293), [#294](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/294), [#296](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/296), [#298](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/298), [#301](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/301), [#303](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/303), [#310](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/310), [#311](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/311), [#320](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/320), [#321](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/321)).
- **Added** MQTT Insights: optional `[MQTT_INSIGHTS]` section publishes internal state (grid power, targets, saturation, consumer topology, EMA poll interval) to MQTT with Home Assistant Device Discovery; per-consumer active/pause + manual target control; Shelly battery offline availability; auto-configured in the HA app when Mosquitto is installed ([#292](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/292), [#294](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/294), [#297](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/297), [#300](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/300), [#306](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/306)).
- **Added** optional Marstek MQTT responder alongside MQTT Insights (HA is the main use case): when `[MARSTEK]` is configured, AstraMeter can answer CT002/CT003 poll traffic on the same broker using the managed cloud MAC; with [hame-relay](https://github.com/tomquist/hame-relay) **≥ 1.3.5** on that broker the Marstek mobile app shows live readings (see README, MQTT Insights). On by default; set `MARSTEK_MQTT_ENABLED = false` in `[MQTT_INSIGHTS]` to disable only this add-on.
- **Added** opt-in web-based configuration editor (`WEB_CONFIG_ENABLED = True` in `[GENERAL]`) accessible at `http://<host>:52500/config`; supports editing all config sections and keys with type-appropriate inputs, comment preservation, and a Save & Restart button ([#319](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/319)).
- **Added** HomeWizard P1 powermeter via the device WebSocket API, with optional `VERIFY_SSL` ([#231](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/231), [#254](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/254)).
- **Added** Enphase IQ Gateway (Envoy) powermeter via the local HTTPS `production.json` API, with optional Enlighten-cloud token acquisition and automatic refresh on 401, and auto-detection of single- vs three-phase readings ([#245](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/245)).
- **Added** SMA Energy Meter / Sunny Home Manager support via Speedwire multicast with device auto-detection and per-phase readings ([#252](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/252)).
- **Added** SML powermeter for smart meters over a local serial port (IR head), with optional per-phase OBIS overrides ([#229](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/229)).
- **Added** multi-phase support to the MQTT powermeter via `TOPICS` / `JSON_PATHS` ([#280](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/280), [issue #136](https://github.com/tomquist/b2500-meter/issues/136)).
- **Added** multi-phase support to the Tasmota powermeter via comma-separated `JSON_POWER_MQTT_LABEL` ([#281](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/281)).
- **Added** multi-phase support to the VZLogger powermeter via comma-separated `UUID` values; phases are fetched in parallel ([#332](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/332)).
- **Added** PID controller support for any powermeter via `PID_KP`, `PID_KI`, `PID_KD`, `PID_OUTPUT_MAX`, and `PID_MODE` (global or per-section), with built-in anti-windup ([#315](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/315)).
- **Added** per-powermeter EMA smoothing and deadband wrappers — `SMOOTH_TARGET_ALPHA`, `MAX_SMOOTH_STEP`, `DEADBAND` (global `[GENERAL]` fallback with per-section override; off by default) ([#331](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/331)).
- **Added** optional Hampel outlier filter for noisy powermeter sources (MQTT / HTTP / WiFi glitches): `HAMPEL_WINDOW`, `HAMPEL_N_SIGMA`, `HAMPEL_MIN_THRESHOLD` (global `[GENERAL]` fallback with per-section override; off by default; sits in the wrapper chain after throttling and before EMA smoothing) ([#334](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/334)).
- **Added** `POWER_OFFSET` and `POWER_MULTIPLIER` transforms for any powermeter, including per-phase calibration, sign flipping, and phase nulling; the Home Assistant app exposes both as optional advanced fields ([#250](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/250), [#308](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/308)).
- **Added** `DEDUPE_TIME_WINDOW` to the Shelly emulator to drop burst-repeat requests from the same battery IP; the value can also be set under `[GENERAL]` to apply regardless of which device type is emulated ([#333](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/333)).
- **Added** MQTT broker configuration via a single `BROKER_URI` (auth and TLS schemes) alongside the existing host/port/user/pass keys ([#309](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/309)).
- **Added** optional Marstek cloud auto-registration for managed fake CT devices at startup under `[MARSTEK]` ([#237](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/237)).
- **Added** `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable support for Docker and CLI runs ([#174](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/174)).
- **Added** timestamps to application log lines ([#260](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/260)).
- **Added** `GIT_COMMIT_SHA` embedding in CI-built container images; startup logs the git commit and `/health` JSON includes `git_commit` when set ([#273](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/273)).
- **Added** `exc_info` to logger warnings for better debugging ([#307](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/307)).

### Changed
- **Switched** the Home Assistant powermeter integration from REST polling to the WebSocket API ([#232](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/232)).
- **Expanded** Shelly emulation logs to report battery detection, inactivity, and reconnection events ([#241](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/241)).
- **Reduced** throttling output noise by replacing unconditional `print` calls in `ThrottledPowermeter` with structured logging (`logger.debug` for routine wait/fetch/cache messages; failures remain at error level) ([#251](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/251)).
- **Improved** Shelly UDP server robustness by adding socket timeouts to avoid hangs during shutdown and testing ([#233](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/233)).
- **Upgraded** `JSON_PATHS` parsing in the JSON HTTP and MQTT powermeters to the `jsonpath-ng` extended syntax, so values that arrive with a unit suffix (e.g. openHAB `Number:Power` returning `"331.74 W"`) can be sanitized inside the path with `` `split(...)` `` or `` `sub(/regex/, replacement)` `` instead of failing the float conversion ([#349](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/349)).

### Fixed
- **Fixed** Modbus `UNIT_ID` handling and clarified Home Assistant entity ID configuration in the docs ([#191](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/191), [#195](https://github.com/tomquist/astrameter/pull/195)).
